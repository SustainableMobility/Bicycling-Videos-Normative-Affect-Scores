# Establishing Normative Scores of Affect, Safety, and Comfort for Bicycling Infrastructure and Traffic Conditions in an Australian Representative Sample

## Background
This repository contains the 26 videos used in the study.
The videos depict first-person perspective footage of bike riding in various infrastructure and traffic conditions (see below and full paper for a more detailed overview).
Each video was recorded on handlebar-mounted GoPro Hero Session5 cameras at 720p 30 fps. All videos are 7 seconds in duration.
